# IconForger

## About The Project

IconForger is a personal learning project aimed at building a web-based icon editor and management tool. The application allows users to create, customize, and organize icons for various projects and design needs.

This project is being developed sporadically in my free time as a way to explore and practice modern web development technologies and techniques. It serves as both a practical tool and a playground for implementing new skills.

## Technologies

IconForger leverages the following technologies:

- **Frontend:**

  - Angular
  - TypeScript
  - RxJS
  - Angular Material
  - SVG manipulation libraries
  - SCSS/CSS

- **State Management:**

  - NgRx

- **Backend Plans:**

  - Node.js
  - Express
  - MongoDB (for storing user designs)
  - Firebase (authentication)

- **Build Tools:**
  - Angular CLI
  - Webpack

## Features (Planned)

- Interactive icon generator using AI
- Library for organizing and storing created icons
- Export option
- User authentication and cloud storage of designs
- Template system for quick icon creation
- Responsive design for desktop and tablet use
- Free trial, and a paywall

## Development Status

This project is currently in early development. Features are being implemented incrementally as time permits. The codebase may contain experimental approaches and is subject to significant refactoring as the project evolves.
